## :nerd_face: Who am I?

I am a 21 year old self-taught developer with knowledge in various industry standard technologies. I am from Kolkata, India. I have almost 3 years of internship experience in more than 4 companies on various technologies. I am currently in my 3rd year of B.Tech course in SRM University, Ramapuram, Chennai. I have released some open source projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Arjis2020) profile and also [npm](https://nmpjs.com/~chatereum).
